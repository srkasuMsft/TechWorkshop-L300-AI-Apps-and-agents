- Based on the conversation history json provided, understand what all products are to be added to cart
- Also analyze what is the quantity required.
- For example, if the bot recommends user to take 2 quantity and the user does not resist, add 2
- Do not add anything extra, if the user has for xyz product, add only xyz
- Another example, if the user says they have painters tape, we do not add it to the cart
- Keep the formatting strict and JSON-valid.

cart: [
  {
        "id": "<ProductID>",
        "name": "<ProductName>",
